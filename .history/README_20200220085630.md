### Server Side Login Example using uPort Credential

Creating a simple login solution with uport-credentials can be accomplished with a small Node.js application to request verified data about an Ethereum identity

In a minimal example, data is requested and a uPort client representing the ethereum identity approves the disclosure of the requested information. This is called a selective disclosure request and is the primary means by which to validate the credentials of a user.

After server-side business logic has been satisfied with the disclosed data, a user can be considered authenticated by virtue of the of verified credentials they disclosed.

The intention of this content is to provide a simple solution to bring familiarity to core concepts in uPort's ecosystem.

The following examples utilize the selective disclosure flow and request/response patterns to provide an example of how to use these concepts for a login scenario:


    Selective Disclosure flow
    Selective Disclosure Request
    Selective Disclosure Response

In addition to the above concepts and uport-credentials, also note the following requirements before starting this example:

    NodeJS
    Create a folder for the example and cd ./example && npm init
    Install dependencies npm install --save ngrok express did-jwt uport-transports uport-credentials

This content is best if followed by interacting with a node console.
